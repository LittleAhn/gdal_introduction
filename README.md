#Abstract: 
Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL/OGR) is the most widely used open source library for raster and vector geospatial data formats. GDAL supports over 50 raster formats and OGR over 20 vector formats. It provides the primary data access engine for many applications such as MapServer, GRASS, and QGIS and has been utilized by major packages such as FME, and ArcGIS. This workshop introduces participants to the powerful GDAL to manipulate raster and vector files for Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing analysis. 

#Objectives: 
Participants will learn raster and vector operations using GDAL/OGR library. They will learn (i) understand what GDAL is, and how it is used (ii) write single line GDAL commands to process raster and vector data (iii) know how to interpret the help dialog for issuing GDAL commands (iv) write GDAL batch scripts to automate many common geoprocessing operations  such as merging, cropping and re-projecting, mosaicing, and filtering images.
